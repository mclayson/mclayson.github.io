                    <h4>How do we plan to meet the needs of our visitors?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our web app provides a streamlined experience. We focus all of the essential current climate conditions front and center. Everything that goes into our web app is to provide our patended "one glance" experience, so our users can get back to doing the amazing work that they do.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How is our content organized?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The most important information, the current weather condition, is placed front and center. It's easy to see and even easier to understand as our users see the very large image that describes the current weather condition.
                        <br>
                        In the Clay-tec weather app, there is no scrolling necessary. All available information is provided in a single screen, "one glance" experience.
                        <br>
                        The 3 cities for which we provide information are separated by tabs located on the top of the page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Do we facilitate people in a mobile environment?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, of course! We understand that the busy go-doers of the business world don't have time to be dilly-dallying on a weather app that was designed for a desktop. They need the information where ever they are! Our design philosophy is a mobile-first appoach. Cut the fat, go "one glance!"
