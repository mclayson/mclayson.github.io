                    <h4>Demographics</h4>

                    </p>
                    <h4>How does this site meet the needs of their visitors?</h4>
                    <p>
                        On the home page, the first call to action "above the fold" is "learn HTML". It is very clear from the beginning what you can learn on this site.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How is their content organized?</h4>
                    <p>
                        They list nicely all of the programming languages you can learn on the home page as well as in their hamburger menu.
                        <br>
                        Sections are sorted by: HTML/CSS, Javascript, Server Side, Web Builing, and XML Tutorials
                    </p>
                    <h4>How does this site meet the needs of their visitors?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Buttons are big enough to touch. Everything you wouldd expect from the desktop version of the site is avaiable. Everything has a clean look and feels good.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, as an education site, they offer their services reguardless of how or when people plan to visit. They revolve their content around the user's needs.

                        <br>
                        Experience: little to no programming experience
                        <br>
                        Proffesional background: A handful of odd jobs to earn money for school
                        <br>
                        Reason for visiting this site: This user has come to the site looking for information about HTML for his web development class.
                        <br>
                        He has searched google on HTML tutorials but many of them have been confusing or beyond his skill level.
                        <br>
                        User's device of choice: This user is likely to use a laptop for homework, thus this site as well. He will probably be in his apartment or on campus. He does most of his browsing on his phone, however, so when he doesn't have his laptop on him he may do some study sessions from his phone.
                        <br>
                        Motivations: This user is motivated by a desire to get good grades and be successful, by fun and fast paced experiences, and looks for the quickest way to understand programming concepts to finish his assignments as fast as possible.

                    <h3>Contrast</h3>


                    <h4>What was the worst site you came across during the 24 hour mobile browsing experience?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The worst site I came accross during my 24 hour mobile experience was Keenspot. http://keenspot.com/
                    </p>

                    <h4>How did your best site differ from the worst in knowing who their target audience was?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The best site clearly showed that it knew who its target audience was by making things easy to understand and presented in a way that can be quicky consumed. The worst site was cluttered and unorganized. So it was hard to determine who their target audience is.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How did your best site differ from the worst in meeting the needs of their audience?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The needs of the worst site's audience are met by presenting the comics they have to offer right on the home page. However, with the cluttered layout and absolutly no mobile version of the site, it was a frustrating experience to use on a phone. In contrast, the best site presented all of the needed content in a clean way on both the desktop and on the phone.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How did your best site differ from the worst in organizing content to facilitate it being found?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The best site organized its content in a clean menu system that made it easy to find exactly what you're looking for. The worst site just threw everything they had on the home page, which made it hard to sort through.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How did your best site differ from the worst in facilitating visitors in a mobile environment?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As stated before, the worst site did not offer a mobile version of the site, so the use is required to zoom in and out of the content trying to find what they are looking for. The best site had a clean, easy-to-use mobile experience.
